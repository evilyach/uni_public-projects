# University Projects

This is a collection of my university projects (and one school project, my very first one).

## Timeline

### Semester 1
Back it semester 1, we did not do any programming. The only programming project that we did back then was a C++ program with inline assembler, but I have not source code from back then and I did not understand a thing anyway.

### Semester 4
It was a start of my C journey. Presenting to you all, my:
* *prog_course_project_db* - Course project "Car Rent Database" for "Programming Languages" class  
  The task is to implement database functionality within a program without using any database software. I could only use C, that was it.  
  I used dynamic arrays of structs to keep data in tables. That means they can be as big as you want. You could output tables to the screen and to the file, to read later.  
  Then I had to rewrite it on Python, but without using any OOP functionality, so I basically translated my whole program  from C to Python without any changes. It is not pretty and barely works, but it is something.  
  With this project I learned how to dynamically use heap memory to keep any data I want there. I spent a lot of time on it and had a lot of trouble while making it (SEGFAULTs, especially), but I learned a lot about C.
